/*
 * malloc.c --
 *
 * Memory allocator.
 *   Magic no longer contains its own version of malloc(), as all modern
 *   operating systems have implementations which are as good or better.
 *
 *   The main thing this file does is to define mallocMagic and friends.
 *   freeMagic frees the previously requested memory item, not the one
 *   passed as the argument.  This allows efficient coding of loops which
 *   run through linked lists and process and free them at the same time.
 *
 *   ALWAYS use mallocMagic() with freeMagic() and NEVER mix them with
 *   malloc() and free().
 *
 *   Malloc trace routines have been removed.  There are standard methods
 *   to trace memory allocation and magic doesn't need its own built-in
 *   method.
 *
 *   The Tcl/Tk version of magic makes use of Tcl_Alloc() and Tcl_Free()
 *   which allows the Tcl/Tk version to trace memory using Tcl's methods.
